Program where you can store data of different moving boxes and their items.
Then with the name of a certain moving box you can add items or list the
items out, transferring items between boxes is also possible. You can also
list out the data of all the boxes or search/count items in the boxes.

Everything in this program is written in English because I didn't want to mix
two languages together. The feedback can be given in Finnish and I will choose
that option in plussa, just wanted to write this here so that
it would be clearer.
